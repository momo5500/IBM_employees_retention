# 📉 HR Attrition Analysis – Mini Data Science Project

This project explores a dataset on employee attrition to uncover the key factors behind employee turnover.  
Using real HR data from an organisation, I applied business analytics tools to find trends and generate insights.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify patterns and profiles of employees likely to leave
- Explore how age, income, department, overtime, satisfaction levels and other variables affect attrition
- Apply machine learning to predict future attrition

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn)
- Google Colab
- Exploratory data analysis & classification model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

## 📊 Key Insights
- Younger and underpaid employees are more likely to leave
- OverTime is a strong predictor of attrition
- Environment satisfaction plays a subtle but important role
- Prediction models require balancing techniques due to class imbalance

## 🚀 Why this project?
As a Business Analytics MBA student at Université Laval, I built this mini-project to sharpen my skills, explore HR data, and simulate how real companies could extract value from their workforce data.
